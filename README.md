# YouTube Content Creator Assistant

The YouTube Content Creator Assistant is a tool developed at Hacktech 2018 to help YouTube content creators conveniently access and interpret analytics data and information about their channel. It leveraged the Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) for natural language processing and the Google YouTube API to interact with raw data from YouTube. It also employed the Microsoft Text Analytics API to provide analysis on sentiment within comments.
